Hello world,

My name is Toan Bui. I'm a Junior Software Engineer.

I aspire to pursue a Computer Science major at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology).

I want to connect with the world and make it a better place.

I have an idea about Genetic Information Management.

Essentially, this idea is an application that aggregates all quality genetic information, various types of genetic codes along with scientific research to propose more suitable lifestyles based on the genetic makeup of each individual.

Thank you for visiting, if you have any interesting ideas about genetics, please let me know.

Feel free to suggest any modifications or additions!
